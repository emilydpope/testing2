Excerpt from "The Chants of Maldoror" by Comte de Lautreamont
(I strongly recommend this book - this is not a direct excerpt, but lyrics from a death metal song adapted from the original work)
There are moments in life
When man with his louse ridden hair
Casts wild staring looks
At the green membranes of space, for he believes
He hears, somewhere ahead
The wry hoots of a phantom
He staggers and bows his head
What he has heard is the voice of his own conscience
He is determined and alert
And with the speed of a madman he rushes out
Takes the first direction his worn state suggests
And bounds over the rough plains of the wield
But the yellow phantom never loses sight of him
Chasing him with equal speed, sometimes on stormy nights
When legions of winged octopi which look like ravens at a distance
Hover above the clouds, moving ponderously
Towards the cities of men, there in the dark
Their mission is to warn them on such nights the dark eyed grit
Sees two beings passing by one after another
And wiping a furtive tear of compassion
Which flows out from its frozen eye
It shouts out, "Yes, certainly he deserves it
It is only justice being done" having said that
He re-assumes his grim attitude and continues to watch
And continues to watch, trembling nervously, the manhunt
The phantom makes a clicking sound with its tongue as if to tell itself
It's giving up the chase, his is the voice of the condemned
And when its dreadful shrieking penetrates the human heart
Man would prefer to have death as his mom
Than to have remorse as his son, I have seen him
Making for the sea, climbing a jagged promontory
Lashed by the eyebrow of the surge
And flinging himself down, into the waves
The miracle is this, the corpse reappeared the next day
On the surface of the raging sea
Which had brought this flotsam of pale flesh back to the shore
The man freed himself from his body's imprint in the sand
He wrung the water from his drenched hair
The man freed himself from his body's imprint in the sand
Wrung the water from his drenched hair
And silently returned to the way of life
